          Jin is the oldest of the group, and he is referred to as WWH (World-wide handsome),
          and he is the group's visual. Jin frequently displays
          self-confidence, which gives most army members the courage
          to have the same level of confidence as he does.
           He was also well-known for his v-lives that helped
          armys with eating disorders;
          these were similar to the "Eat with me" videos.
          His sense of humour is sarcasm and dad jokes,
          but he is actually rather hilarious,
          which makes him not only attractive but also humorous.

        Suga is known for having the appearance of a cat and is, in fact, a cat person. He is shy because of his introverted nature, which make him appear mysterious, He is also an extremely talented rapper. He is a very kind person, which contributes significantly to his lovable personality.

        J-hope is a very lively and energetic person. Despite receiving a lot of criticism and having almost no fans at first, he is now receiving the recognition he deserves. In his episode on IU's show, I saw a completely different side of him; he is shy, hardworking, and all around incredibly kind and lovely. He is truly an amazing person who has endured a lot, and I admire him for that.

        I adore RM for a variety of reasons, including his speech at UNICEF 2018. He helped many armys develop self-assurance in their skills and abilities, which allowed many of them to succeed at what they love. His raps are deeply moving, and he demonstrates his exceptional leadership abilities in interviews by translating for everyone and attempting to shield them from hate. A lot of people adore RM because he has a compassionate nature.

        In general, Jimin is a remarkable individual who causes most, if not all, of those who encounter him to fall in love with him at first sight. In addition to his attractive appearance, Jimin also has a very endearing demeanour.

      <p class="memberparaodd">MBTI: INFP <br> <br> Zodiac sign: Capricorn <br> <br>
        One of the most well-liked members is Taehyung, who is adored by Armys for both his attractiveness and his mysterious, quiet demeanour. He spent more than a week preparing for an interview to perfect his English, but the interviewer didn't ask (perhaps presuming he didn't know English), and you could see that he was pretty upset after that interview. Other members interviewed him instead to comfort him.

        Our golden maknae jungkook is the youngest among them.
Even if you don't enjoy K-pop, you have to admit that he has incredible vocals. He is also attractive and very nice. He is the most liked member of the group and the only one who belongs to Generation Z, which makes him more relatable to our generation than the other members.

        Most armys admire BTS because of the influence they had on them, whether physically, mentally, or professionally. Even if you aren't a fan, you undoubtedly know one personally. They are the inspiration behind many of BTS' songs. ARMIES are regarded to be the biggest fandom in the world.
They are also the reason for many of their accomplishments like setting records, winning prizes, and so on.(and obviously BTS' talent is a major factor too)
